##### **Overview**

* The original model was developed in 'Relative contributions of transmission routes for
COVID-19 among healthcare personnel providing
patient care' [(Jones, 2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32643585).

* CEMRA uses a compartmental model of nine states within a room to estimate virus transport and fate for contact and inhalation transmission, implemented using a discrete-time Markov chain.

* The room is split up into a near-field and far field zone (1 metre surrounding the infectious individual). In these areas the virus can be in the air and on surfaces.  

* Droplet transmission from coughing is based on respiratory droplet size distribution, extrapolated to the expiratory volume, with a probability of impacting the face in proportion to the surface area of the mucous membranes.



* An overview of the model is presented in Figure 1. A more detailed version is available [here](https://iomworld.box.com/s/f0ubyg6uilc08qdpgw1hk4bddhg83dc7).

* Updated data - viral load, susecptible behaviour data from CSO/PROTECT projects

* Updated procedures - more than one person ill, reproducibility

* Updated visualisations - waffle and violin plots 

* The application is aimed at comparisons between different scenarios.

* There are a selection of pre-loaded scenarios that can get you started.

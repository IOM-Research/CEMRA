<p>Fransman, Schinkel (16) compiled a database summarising the literature on the efficacy of local ventilation and other engineering control measures for chemicals and dust, known as the Exposure Control Efficacy Library or ECEL. This provides a comprehensive assessment of the literature until the end of 2007. They obtained a total of 433 efficacy values for six Risk Management Measure (RMM) groups (i.e. Enclosure, Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV), Specialised Ventilation, General Ventilation, Suppression Techniques, and Separation of the Worker), which were collected from 90 peer-reviewed publications. These data suggest that most control measures will reduce exposure to at most a tenth of the level that would be present without controls. Some very well designed control measures, for example specialised local ventilation systems, may reduce exposure to between about one hundredth to one thousandth of the level present without controls. The literature published since Fransman et al’s review are broadly consistent with their findings. For the NIOSH ventilated headboard we use the efficacy figures for “Specialised ventilation”, i.e. mean efficacy 87% and lower and upper bounds of 73 – 94%. The above values are lower than the developers of the ventilated headboard quote from their laboratory tests, but these were undertaken in idealised circumstances.</p>

<p>Rather than express the degree of protection provided by a respirator in terms of the effectiveness of the device to reduce exposure it is common to present the effectiveness as a protection factor (PF), i.e. the ratio of the exposure level outside the device to that inside the facepiece.  It is straightforward to convert from one system to the other and so a PF of 10 implies the respirator is 90% efficient and PF of 100 is equivalent to 99% efficiency in reducing exposure. effectiveness may also be expressed as “total inward leakage”, which is 100 minus the efficacy as a percentage. Studies of the effectiveness of respiratory protection have demonstrated that respirators can have a similar range of effectiveness in reducing average exposure to engineering systems, i.e. between about a factor of ten to one thousand or more. The assignment of protection factors is described in various national standards and the approach is generally based on the 95th percentile of the distribution of protection factors rather than some measure of the average protection afforded. Assigned Protection Factors are therefore a poor guide to the typical protection provided by respirators and are more comparable to the lower confidence interval of source RMM. In this study we are interested in defining the efficacy (or PF) for three types of respirator: FFP3 (N99), FFP2 (and he equivalent N95) and surgical masks.

Janssen, Nelson (17) assessed the performance of an N95 filtering facepiece respirator in a steel foundry. They had 49 pairs of samples and the calculated PFs ranged from 5 to 753. The geometric mean was 119 with a lower 5th percentile 19 (upper 95th percentile around 800); mean 166 (efficacy 99.4%). Gao, Koehler (18) looked at the performance of facepiece respirators and surgical masks against surgical smoke in a simulated workplace protection factor study. Ten subjects were recruited to perform surgical dissections on animal tissue in a chamber, using a standard electrocautery device, generating surgical smoke. Six respiratory protective devices were tested: two surgical masks, two N95 respirators, and two N100 respirators (nearest to FFP3). The geometric means PF for the two surgical masks were 1.49 and 1.76 (efficacy 33% and 43%). The PF for the N95s were 208 and 263 (99.5% and 99.6%) and for the two N100s, 1,089 and 2,199 (99.9% and 99.95% efficacy). Cherrie, Apsley (19) tested a range of masks including two N95 type devices. The mean inward leakage for these two masks was 5.6% and 11% (94.5 and 89% efficacy); corresponding 5th and 95th percentiles were around 1% and 70 – 85%. Steinle, Sleeuwenhoek (20) reported data for a N95 respirator and three surgical masks, tested against aloxite dust. Ten volunteers (6 female, 4 male) were recruited. Each mask type was worn by volunteers under two different conditions simulating cleaning-up activities during/after volcanic ashfall.  The arithmetic mean total inward leakage (TIL) for the respirator was 8.6% (91.4% efficacy) and between 22 and 32% for the surgical masks (78% and 68% efficacy); 5th and 95th TIL percentiles were 0.3 – 35% for the respirator and around 5% to around 65% for the surgical masks.  There is no good source of data on the efficacy of respirators against aerosols. Based on the above we used the following values in the CSO project: FFP3 mean efficacy 95% range 70% - 99.5%; FFP2, mean efficacy 90% range 65% - 99% and Surgical masks mean efficacy 65% range 35% - 80%.</p>

<p>Curtis Breslin, Kyle (21) carried out a systematic review of studies intended to identify effective occupational health and safety interventions for small businesses. They identified just five studies that were evaluated to be of medium or high quality, which included a study by Lazovich, Parker (22).  The interventions, which included mixtures of training, health and safety audits, and motivational elements, showed a limited amount of evidence in improving safety outcomes. It was concluded there was a moderate level of evidence for intervention effectiveness, and there was no evidence that any intervention was detrimental to worker health and safety.
The effectiveness of an intervention to reduce wood dust exposure in small woodworking businesses was studied by Lazovich, Parker (22). They randomly allocated 48 businesses to either the intervention (i.e. written recommendations, technical assistance and worker training) or the control group (i.e. written recommendations only). Changes from baseline in dust concentration, dust control methods, and worker behaviour were assessed one year after the intervention was introduced. Note, it was not intended to introduce new control measures into any of these companies as part of the intervention. They showed that there was improvement in worker attitudes and behaviours in intervention relative to comparison businesses (i.e. greater awareness, increased use of the dust control equipment and modest increases in the airflow in the ventilation systems due to better maintenance). The median dust concentration in the intervention group dropped by almost 20% whereas in the corresponding decrease was just over 10%. However, the difference between the two groups (10.4%) was not statistically significant.  The positive changes and the modest reduction in exposure are suggestive of improved attitude and behaviour on the part of the workers as a result of the intervention. Robson, Stephenson (23) carried out a systematic review to investigate whether occupational safety and health training have a beneficial effect on workers (e.g. increase knowledge, improve attitudes, improve behaviours, or protect health). Twenty-two studies met the reviewers inclusion criteria. Ten studies had data on behaviour change; six had “large” statistically significant changes in behaviour but the remainder showed small or no important changes. Overall, they found strong evidence for the effectiveness in changing worker behaviour, but there was insufficient evidence to judge the effectiveness in protecting health. However, the reviewers concluded that any impacts of training on health were likely to be modest. Finally, Ricci, Chiesi (24) also carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to verify the efficacy of occupational health and safety training in terms of knowledge, attitude and beliefs, behaviour and health. The 28 identified studies showed strong support for the effectiveness of training on worker attitudes and beliefs and, to a lesser extent, on worker’s knowledge but only medium for behaviour and little evidence for its effectiveness on health. Overall, training on its own has a small effect on (self-reported) safety behaviours in the workplace and likely less effect on actual behaviour and consequently health protection.</p>

<p><strong> Modelling covid-19 risk</strong></p>



<p><strong>Transmission routes</strong></p>

COVID-19 can be transmitted between individuals through three routes: inhalation of aerosols, deposition of droplets on the facial mucous membranes and contact with infected surfaces transfered to the mucous membranes via hand or tool. 
<p><strong>Dose Response</strong></p>



<p><strong> Exposure Model </strong></p>

<p>The original model was developed in 'Relative contributions of transmission routes for
COVID-19 among healthcare personnel providing
patient care' <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32643585" target="_blank">(Jones, 2020)</a>.

CEMRA uses a compartmental model of nine states within a room to estimate virus transport and fate for fomite and inhalation transmission, implemented using a discrete-time Markov chain. Droplet transmission from coughing is based on respiratory droplet size distribution, extrapolated to the expiratory volume, with a probability of impacting the face in proportion to the surface area of the mucous membranes.

# CEMRA (COVID-19 Exposure Model and Risk App)
 
CEMRA originated from the following Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment model by Jones, 2020 - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15459624.2020.1784427

CEMRA is a web application developed using the original model, which allows the user to modify the virus load, emissions, controls, patients behaviour and susceptible behaviour.

The general steps for use of CEMRA are as follows:

1. Choose which scenario fits the location that you are interested in (or upload your own)
2. Choose which parameters you would like to modify 
3. Run the model 
4. Compare the model to the baseline scenario
5. Interpret results

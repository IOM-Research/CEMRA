<p><strong>Viral load and shedding</strong></p>
Infectiousness is made from three parameters: the concentration of SARS-COV-2 in saliva, the rate of virus emission in exhaled breath and the frequency of coughing. We constructed infectioness in the following way. 

For the concentration of SARS-COV-2 in saliva we use a study by Chen et al., 2021. A weibull distribution fit the pooled data, with a shape factor of 3.47 and a scale factor of 7.01 for the log10 RNA/ml. In CEMRA, we change the scaling factor in increments of one going from 2 in "Extremely low infectious" (mean of 1.81 RNA/ml) to 8 in "Extremely high infectious" (mean of 7.22 RNA/ml). 

For the rate of virus emission in exaled breath we used three studies. The first study of 17 individuals with human seasonal coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2) found a minimum of 20 gene copies per hour (Leung). The second study in 9 ready-to-discharge/recovering patients found levels between 73,500 to 77,700  RNA copies per 30 minutes (Zhou). The third study estimated that SARS-Cov-2 emission is 10^3 to 10^5 RNA copies per minute, from 35 patients with COVID-19 using BioScreen device (Ma). A log normal distribution was used to roughly approximate this data, with the assumption that most people are low emitters (80/20). In CEMRA, we change the mean log in increments of one from 1 in "Extremely low infectious" (mean of 9.52 RNA/min) to 8 in "Extremely high infectious" (mean of 3,844 RNA/min). 

We used two studies on patient coughing. The first study estimated the cough frequency in otherwise healthy volunteers with an acute upper respiratory tract infection related cough as being 12.1 per hour (12). In the second study coughing was assumed to happen every 30 seconds (120 per hour) as described for a person with a chronic dry cough (13). The second study was used in a recent COVID-19 modelling study (14). A triangular distribution was used to roughly approximate this data. In CEMRA, we change the minimum, maximum and mode frequency of coughing parameters in increments of ten from 1, 10 and 5 in "Extremely low infectious" to 60,70,65 in "Extremely high infectious". 

We assume that these three parameters scale linearly, i.e. a person coughs more will also have higher viral load and higher exhaled breath emissions. </html>

<p><strong> Modelling covid-19 risk</strong></p>
There are many ways to model covid-19 transmission... 

<p><strong>Transmission routes</strong></p>
COVID-19 can be transmitted between individuals through three routes: inhalation of aerosols, deposition of droplets on the facial mucous membranes and contact with infected surfaces transfered to the mucous membranes via hand or tool. 

<p><strong> Exposure Model </strong></p>
<p>The original model was developed in 'Relative contributions of transmission routes for
COVID-19 among healthcare personnel providing
patient care' <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32643585" target="_blank">(Jones, 2020)</a>.

CEMRA uses a compartmental model of nine states within a room to estimate virus transport and fate for contact and inhalation transmission, implemented using a discrete-time Markov chain. Droplet transmission from coughing is based on respiratory droplet size distribution, extrapolated to the expiratory volume, with a probability of impacting the face in proportion to the surface area of the mucous membranes. The dose response-function is derived from an exponential function fitted to pooled data about <strong>SARS CoV</strong> infectivity in mice, The probability of infection is given as: P(infection) = 1 – exp(-d/410), where d is the dose. 

Updated data - viral load, susecptible behaviour, data from CSO/PROTECT projects

Updated procedures - more than one person ill, reproducibility

Updated visualisations - waffle and violin plots 


<p><strong> Limitations</strong></p>
<p>
Underestimating viral shedding
Patients’ EB exhibited viral shedding of up to 1.59 × 10^6 RNA copies per hour (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221005671).
